    "# Data exploration regarding strategies to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak\n",

    "## Preliminary Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question which made me start the analysis is: What is the best strategy for a state to battle the Covid-19 outbreak. There are several debates on how to act on overcoming this global pandemic. There are goverments that want to prevent overburdening of the health system through the lockdown like the spanish or german, while other countries rely on the responsibility of the individual without major restrictions, namely the swedish. Futhermore, there are governments that do not see any danger through the virus for their population or at least evaluate the economic damage through a lockdown more dramatically than the effects of the virus itself. Data was gathered from Wikipedia, Gapminder and the John Hopkins University. The amount of confirmed cases of Covid-19, deaths and recovered of the John Hopkins Data paired with information like intensive care beds retrieved from wikipedia ist the basis of this analysis. With this data the outbreaks timelines of different countries can be compared in the context of their strategies."

Each row holds the following variables for one country on one date: accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19, accumulated fatal cases related to Covid-19 and cases recovered from Covid-19. There are 20,475 observations in this dataset on May 18th 2020. This data is gathered by the [John Hopkins University](https://hub.jhu.edu/novel-coronavirus-information/) and daily updated with new observations. All variables but country names are of numeric nature.\n",
    "This dataset is complemented by another dataset df_covidTests_Snapshot by the [Unitversity of Oxford](https://ourworldindata.org/about) tracking tests perfomed by countries. The dataset df_covidTests_Snapshot only contains the most recent values available for 92 countries.\n",
    "Further numeric statistics like population size or area of 207 countries is part of the dataframe df_countryMetrics_Snapshot.\n",
    "The dataframe df_householdsEU_Timeline holds ordinal categorical data regarding the distribution of the population among household sizes. Household sizes, 1 person, 2 persons, 3 persons, 4 persons, 5 persons, 6 persons or more.\n",
    "Further information in numeric form about hospital beds, for example existing intensive care units per countries are in the dataframe df_hospitals_Snapshot.\n",
    "Reference data regarding birth and death rates of countries month wise over the past years is available in df_populationDelta_Timeline. With this data it will be possible to determine the mortality displacement for the year 2020, probably caused by Covid-19 or secondary effects of the pandemic.\n",

These countries have similar cultures, weather and household situations. Therefore I see them fit for a comparison of strategies. How did Sweden perform as a country with very soft measures regarding lockdown against the Covid-19 pandmic compared to the other nordic countries and Germany.\n",

    "The graphic above shows the confirmed cases of each country per one million inhabitants. Here we can see a different ranking compared to the graphic with absolute amount of confirmed Covid-19 cases. Sweden with 364 cases per one million inhabitants has by far the highest rate. Next with roughly 95 cases per one million inhabitants are Germany and Denmark. Finland with 54 and Norway with 43 have the lowest rate of the countries shown in this graphic. Infections are not necessarily dangerous, still some of those infected have to seek medical treatment and are at risk of long-term damage or even death. \n",
    "This rate may be far from reality, as the confirmed cases of Covid-19 may not necessarily correspond to the actual number of cases. The number of known Covid-19 infections for a country depends on the number of tests performed. The more a country tests, the closer the number of confirmed infections should be to the actual number of infections present. When the decentrally collected figures are combined, delays or individual errors may introduce further uncertainties into the statistics. \n",

Different countries and regions have different rules as to when a death is included in the statistics of deaths caused by Covid-19. \n",
