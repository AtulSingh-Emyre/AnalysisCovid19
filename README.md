# Comparison of the Covid-19 spread among European Countries
## by Leopold Walther


## Introduction

The main question which made me start the analysis is: What is the best strategy for a state to battle the Covid-19 outbreak. There are several debates on how to act on overcoming this global pandemic.

There are goverments that want to prevent overburdening of the health system through the lockdown like the spanish or german, while other countries rely on the responsibility of the individual without major restrictions, namely the swedish. Futhermore, there are governments that evaluate the economic damage through a lockdown more dramatically than the effects of the virus itself.

## Dataset

Base of this analysis is data related to the spread of Covid-19 over time by the [John Hopkins University](https://hub.jhu.edu/novel-coronavirus-information/).

This data is complemented by statistics about tests and other generic information about countries gathered by the [Unitversity of Oxford](https://ourworldindata.org/about).

Statistics regarding the distribution of the population among household sizes in Europe are retrieved from the [European statistical database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database).

## Summary of Findings

There are a lot of factors that have effect on how a virus can spread over the
population of a country. One factor is the distribution of the population
over household sizes. Main finding of this analysis is the correlation of the
household size of european countries to the amount of infections and deaths
related to Covid-19.

## Key Insights for Presentation

Norway has a mortality rate of 2.8% by May 17th, which lies in the first quartile
of mortality rate of all countries. Denmark and Germany have a mortality rate
somewhere between 4% and 5%, which corresponds to the second quartile, meaning
that their mortality rates are below the worlds mean mortality rate. Sweden with
12,2% is in the fourth quartile. Again, the mortality rate we calculated here is
based on the numbers submitted by each country. Countries performing less tests
tend to subestimate the amount of infections and therefore the resulting mortality
rate is overestimated.

Knowing the distribution of population on household sizes for Europe we can look
into a possible correlation between household sizes and confirmed cases of
Covid-19. The idea is that if one person of a household is infected with Covid-19,
the probability of infecting the other people in the same household is high. It
is hard to prevent further infections in a household, even lockdowns can not stop
the progression of a virus in infected households. So, for a country having
higher shares of households with multiple people in one household, the chances
increase that infections spread in households.
